type: BeamDrill
name: Induction Bore
size: 3
health: 350
description: Fires concentrated energy beams at ores using electric induction coils, yielding trace minerals. Capable of mining from walls.
details: Magnesiumâ€™s high electrical and thermal conductivity allows for the creation of a focused beam of electricity. This beam is not restricted by gravity, allowing for wall boring.
